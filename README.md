Hi, welcome to my project 101, a project to forcast a house price from an Airbnb dataset. (A project from the course Artificial Intelligence and Python in Renmin University of China)
This project could be divided in two part. 
The first part aims to proceed the raw data, do feature engineering and use linear models to predict the price. We found that the performance would be better if we construct some interaction manually.
The second part aims to use advanced models, including tree models and NN models to improve the performance in the first part. I found that Xgboost got the best performance, and the feature I construct in part one made a great contribution.
