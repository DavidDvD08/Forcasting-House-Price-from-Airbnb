Hi, welcome to my project 101, a project to forecast a house price from an Airbnb dataset. (A project from the course Artificial Intelligence and Python at Renmin University of China)
This project could be divided into two parts. 
The first part aims to proceed with the raw data, do feature engineering, and use linear models to predict the price. I found that the performance would be better if I constructed some interaction manually.
The second part aims to use advanced models, including tree models and NN models to improve the performance in the first part. I found that Xgboost got the best performance, and the feature I constructed in part one made a great contribution.
